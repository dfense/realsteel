## ✅ Investor Return Comparison — Base vs Preferred 1.5× Model

**Deal Terms**  
- Investment: **$400,000**  
- Equity: **30%**  
- **Preferred Return:** **1.5×** (investors receive **$600,000** before profit split)  
- Founder Ownership: **70%**

### Base 30% vs Preferred 1.5× (30%)
| Metric | Base 30% Equity | Preferred 1.5× (30%) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Capital Invested | $400,000 | $400,000 |
| Ownership | 30% | 30% |
| Payback Timing | ≈ mid Year 3 | **≈ mid Year 2** |
| Cumulative Return (3 yrs) | $885,000 (2.21×) | **$1,305,000 (3.26×)** |
| ROI % (3 yrs) | 121% | **226%** |
| Founder Ownership Retained | 70% | 70% |

### Preferred Return Explained
Investors are repaid their initial $400,000 plus a **50% preferred return** (**$600,000 total**) **before** any profits are distributed to common shareholders. After this hurdle is reached (≈ **month 18**), profits split pro-rata by ownership (**30% investor / 70% founder**). This structure **accelerates payback** and **increases 3-year ROI**, while preserving founder control.
