## 🕐 Ramp-Up Scenario: Deferred Revenue (First 6 Months)
To allow for **facility build-out, machine setup, and staff training**, commercial production begins mid‑year. This defers initial revenue by six months, reducing **Year 1 revenue by 50%** while keeping setup and staffing costs largely fixed. Outcome: a slower ROI ramp that strengthens operational readiness and long‑term profitability.

| Metric | Base Case | Deferred Build-Out Case |
|:--|--:|--:|
| Revenue | $2,000,000 | **$1,000,000 (–50%)** |
| Material (~40%) | $800,000 | **$400,000** |
| Labor | $300,000 | **$300,000** |
| Overhead & Admin | $150,000 | **$150,000** |
| Marketing & Misc. | $50,000 | **$50,000** |
| **Net Profit (Pre-Tax)** | $700,000 | **$100,000 (5%)** |
